# 30-Day OpenAI Project Challenge 🚀

## Project Overview
This repository documents my 30-day journey of building and improving a project using the OpenAI SDK. The goal is to create a portfolio-worthy project while building consistency, learning new skills, and applying knowledge in practical ways.


## 🎯 Goals
- Build a portfolio-worthy project
- Develop consistency in coding and learning
- Master the OpenAI SDK and its applications
- Document the learning journey
- Create something valuable for future career growth

## 🎯 Project Vision

Build an inventory management system where AI agents can:
- Track stock levels and suggest actions
- Auto-reorder items using rules or AI
- Generate daily/weekly reports
- Interact with a user interface or CLI for updates and decisions
